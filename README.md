* Repo: https://github.com/ludo237/Arcadia-CMS
* Support: http://www.twitter.com/ludo237
* Web Site: http://ludo237.github.io/arcadia-cms/
* Demo site: ***Offline***
 
The purpose is create a simple User Managment System with Laravel 4 because I think it is one of the best PHP Framework at the moment, you should give it a try.
 
This system will be composed by:
- Front end made with "Foundation 4" by Zurb (http://foundation.zurb.com/).
- User sign up and sign in with profile management.
- Admin backend with user management.
- News feed with Auth comments.
- Multilanguage supports (at least two: Italian and English)

	'default' => 'mysql',
	'mysql' => array(
		'driver'    	=> 'mysql',

		'charset'   	=> 'utf8',
		'collation' 	=> 'utf8_unicode_ci',
		'prefix'    	=> '',
	),
